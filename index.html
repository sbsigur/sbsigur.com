    <!-- Summary -->
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        My career began in Denmark where I worked as a software developer. Having dual citizenship, I made the decision
        to relocate to Iceland after an absence spanning several years. Since then I have worked in various countries
        and encountered unique challenges in each of them. In the past couple of years I have been exposed to areas of
        machine learning and the cyber security spectrum. I have gained diverse experience, including deep learning,
        internal system development, and a mission to establish top-notch internet security for the cloud era.
